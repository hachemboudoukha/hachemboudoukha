# Hi there, I'm Hachem! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm a **Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data**, with a strong focus on **Data Engineering, Machine Learning / MLOps, and Generative AI**.

I have a solid background in **computer science, data engineering, and software Engineering **, and I enjoy building **end-to-end data and ML systems** — from data ingestion and processing to model training, deployment, and visualization.

When I'm not coding or studying, I'm usually learning something new, working on side projects, or sharing what I've learned with others. I believe in continuous growth and the power of open collaboration. 

🔍 **Currently seeking:** apprenticeship or work-study opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow alongside talented teams. 



**Focus Areas:**  
• Machine Learning • Large Language Models (LLMs) • Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) • MLOps

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning

- Building and fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific tasks
- Designing RAG pipelines to enhance model capabilities with external knowledge
- MLOps best practices:  experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment automation
- Advanced data engineering techniques for scalable data pipelines



## Let's Connect

I'm always open to interesting conversations, collaboration opportunities, or just a friendly chat about AI and data!
